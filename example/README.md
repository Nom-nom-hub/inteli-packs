# Example Project

A simple Node.js project demonstrating the use of Express, Lodash, and Moment.js.  This project serves as an example for testing purposes.


## Description

This project provides a basic framework for building a Node.js application using Express.js for routing, Lodash for utility functions, and Moment.js for date and time manipulation.  Currently, it's a minimal example and lacks significant functionality beyond a basic server setup.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd example-project
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


## Usage

Start the server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a basic Express.js server.  Currently, there are no defined routes or endpoints.  This is a starting point for further development.


## API Documentation

This project currently does not have a defined API.  Further development would involve defining routes and endpoints to expose functionality.
