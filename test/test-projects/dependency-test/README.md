# Dependency-Test

A simple Node.js project demonstrating the use of Express, Lodash, and Axios.  This project serves as a testbed for dependency management and optimization.

## Description

This project provides a basic framework for building a Node.js application using Express.js for routing, Lodash for utility functions, and Axios for making HTTP requests.  It's designed to be easily extensible and serves as a starting point for more complex projects.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   bash
   cd dependency-test
   3. **Install dependencies:**

   bash
   npm install
   ## Usage

This project includes a basic `index.js` file that demonstrates the use of the included libraries. To run the application:

bash
npm start
This will start the Express.js server. You can then access the application through your browser or using a tool like `curl`.  Currently, no specific routes or functionalities are implemented beyond the basic server setup.  This is intentional to keep the example concise and focused on dependency management.

## API Documentation
