# Dependency-Test

A simple Node.js project demonstrating the use of Express, Lodash, and Axios.  This project serves as a basic template for future development.

## Description

This project provides a minimal example of a Node.js application utilizing popular libraries:

* **Express.js:** For creating a web server.
* **Lodash:** For utility functions.
* **Axios:** For making HTTP requests.

This README outlines the project setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   bash
   cd dependency-test
   3. **Install dependencies:**

   bash
   npm install
   ## Usage

This project currently doesn't have any specific functionality beyond a basic server setup. To run the application:

bash
npm start
This will start the server.  Currently, there are no defined routes or endpoints.  This is a starting point for building a more complex application.
