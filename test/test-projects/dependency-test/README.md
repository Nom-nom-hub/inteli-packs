# Dependency-Test

A simple Node.js project demonstrating the use of Express, Lodash, and Axios.  This project serves as a basic template for future development.


## Description

This project is a minimal example showcasing the integration of popular Node.js packages:

* **Express:** For creating a simple web server.
* **Lodash:** For utility functions.
* **Axios:** For making HTTP requests.

This README provides instructions for setting up, running, and contributing to the project.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   bash
   cd dependency-test
   3. **Install dependencies:**

   bash
   npm install
   ## Usage

This project currently doesn't have any specific functionality beyond a basic Express server.  To run the server:

bash
npm start
This will start the server on the default port (typically 3000).  You can then access the server in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.  Currently, there is no content served; this is a starting point for further development.


## API Documentation

Currently, there is no defined API for this project.  This section will be updated as the project evolves and features are added.
