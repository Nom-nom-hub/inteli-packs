# Inteli-Packs: Smart Developer Assistant for Node.js Project Optimization

Inteli-Packs is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to intelligently analyze your Node.js projects and provide optimization recommendations.  Leveraging 12+ leading AI providers with automatic fallback mechanisms, Inteli-Packs ensures robust and reliable analysis, regardless of provider availability.  It helps improve code quality, security, testing, and overall project health.


## Installation

Inteli-Packs requires Node.js version 16.0.0 or higher and npm version 8.0.0 or higher.  Install it globally using npm:

bash
npm install -g inteli-packs
## Usage

After installation, you can use Inteli-Packs from your terminal.  The basic command structure is:

bash
inteli-packs <command> [options]
Available commands include:

* **`analyze`**: Analyzes your project's dependencies and provides optimization suggestions.  This command utilizes multiple AI providers for a comprehensive analysis.  Example: `inteli-packs analyze` (runs in the current directory).  You can specify a directory using `inteli-packs analyze /path/to/your/project`.

* **`init`**: Initializes a new project with best practices and configurations. Example: `inteli-packs init my-new-project`

* **`validate`**: Validates your project's configuration and structure. Example: `inteli-packs validate`

Other commands are available for specific tasks related to security, testing, DevOps, automation, and documentation.  Run `inteli-packs --help` for a complete list of commands and options.


### Usage Examples

**Analyzing a project:**

bash
inteli-packs analyze ./my-project
This command analyzes the `my-project` directory.  The output will include suggestions for dependency updates, security vulnerabilities, and potential performance improvements.

**Initializing a new project:**

bash
inteli-packs init my-new-project
This creates a new project directory named `my-new-project` with a basic project structure and configuration files.
